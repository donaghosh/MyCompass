# MyCompass
The MyCompass app shows you the direction your Android Phone is pointing. A sensor called a magnetometer is used to measure the strength and direction of magnetic fields. By analyzing Earth's magnetic field, the sensor allows a phone to determine its orientation pretty accurately. 
I have also included comments in my source code for my collaborators.
You can also find screenshot in this repository of MyCompass application.
It is a very simple (63 sloc) 2.52 KB java android application.
